<h1 align="center" id="title">Leon Template</h1>

<p id="description">Leon Template is a web project that I created to practice my skills in HTML and CSS. One of the key features of this template is the navigation list that appears when you hover over navigation icon. This icon is designed to make it easy for users to navigate to different sections of the website. When you hover over the navigation icon a list of sections appears including About Services Portfolio and Contact. This list is designed to be intuitive and easy to use allowing users to quickly navigate to the section that they are interested in. Once you select a section from the list you will be taken directly to that section of the website. This feature is designed to save time and make it easy for users to find the information that they are looking for.</p>
