<h1 align="center" id="title">Leon Template</h1>

<p id="description">Leon Template is a web project that I created to practice my skills in HTML and CSS. One of the key features of this template is the navigation list that appears when you hover over navigation icon. This icon is designed to make it easy for users to navigate to different sections of the website.
  
When you hover over the navigation icon a list of sections appears including About Services Portfolio and Contact. This list is designed to be intuitive and easy to use allowing users to quickly navigate to the section that they are interested in.
  
Once you select a section from the list you will be taken directly to that section of the website. This feature is designed to save time and make it easy for users to find the information that they are looking for.
  
Absolutely! In addition to the navigation icon and intuitive section navigation, Leon Template is also designed to be responsive to different screen sizes. This means that the website will look great on desktops, laptops, tablets, and mobile devices.

To achieve this level of responsiveness, I used media queries in my CSS code. Media queries allow me to specify different styles for different screen sizes, ensuring that the website looks great on any device. This includes adjusting font sizes, image sizes, and layout to ensure that the website is easy to use and visually appealing on any device.

By making Leon Template responsive, I have ensured that the website is accessible to a wider range of users, regardless of the device that they are using to access it. Whether you are viewing the website on a large desktop monitor or a small mobile device, you can be sure that it will look great and be easy to use.</p>
